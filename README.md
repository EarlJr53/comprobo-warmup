Brooke Moss, Lauren Thorbecke, Swasti Jain

## Project Description:

As the warm-up project for A Computational Introduction to Robotics ("CompRobo") Fall 2023, we were tasked to use ROS2 tools to allow our Neato robotic vacuum to perform a number of tasks of increasing complexity.

The tasks are as follows:

-   Teleop: Control the Neato using keystrokes on a laptop. Using `WASD` keys, control the robot's forward/backward motion and turning.

-   Driving in a Square: Write a simple ROS node where the robot drives forward a set distance, turns 90 degrees, and repeats until it has drawn a square.

-   Obstacle Avoidance:

-   Multi-Behaviour:
